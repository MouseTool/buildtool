# #BuildTool
Welcome to the official BuildTool 2.5 open-source repository! BuildTool is a Lua module for the game [Transformice](https://transformice.com), providing a set of useful utilities for Shamans in the game. It is geared towards the building community, additionally supporting the following building minigames:
- #Divinity
- #Spiritual

This is the ~~third~~ seconrdth generation of BuildTool, born out of increasing acknowledgement since 2018 and the need for a more solid codebase to maintain easily.

# Development Information
## Building / Compiling script
You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). After that, clone this repository and run the following commands in the command line. This will install the required Node.js and Lua dependencies needed to build this module.
```
cd buildtool
npm install
```

You can then compile the BuildTool script directly from the command line:
```
npm run-script build
```

Or alternatively, a minified version:
```
npm run-script minify
```

# Coding Environment
We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) which is supported on all major platforms, with the following extension installed – [Lua Language Server (sumneko.lua)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua). This is to harness auto-completion and other features like type hinting based on Lua docs (Emmylua format).
